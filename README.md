My Personal VimRC
=================

##Plugin's Used
  To install Plugin's in my .vimrc i'm using [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) since it is the best Plugin Manager
  
  #[UltiSnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips):
    Together with [vim-snippets](https://github.com/honza/vim-snippets) it makes a very powerful Addon to have in vim
